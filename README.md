# Predicting Car Stopping Distance

The goal of this project is to predict a car’s stopping distance by constructing a predictive model that will utilize the car’s speed and the corresponding stopping distance.

## Data 

The source of the dataset is Ezekiel, M. (1930) Methods of Correlation Analysis. Wiley.
They note the dataset is from the decade of the last century - the 1920’s.

The dataset has two numerical attributes:

- speed - speed of the car in mph
- dist - stopping distance in feet

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

Refer to the .ipynb file in the repo in order to run in in your environment. 

## Images

Images were used to create reports that can be found in the deliverables folder.
